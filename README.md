Hello everyone! I am Vinay Poojary, a dedicated student and enthusiast of Sanskrit literature. As I progress in my studies, my goal is to provide detailed grammatical analyses of Mantras, Shlokas, and Subhashitas. After going through many websites/blogs I prefer presenting my findings in a tabular format to ensure the breakdowns are clear and easy to follow. Let me know if you have any suggestion or findings.
